   <h1>Pollution In Ocean</h1> 
   <p>Pollution is a serious problem that a lot of people ignore. This is serious because it is not heathly for us to drink it and it will soon be undrinkable and we will have no water. Another reason why this is bad is for the animals that live in the oceans. Some animals are almost going extinct because they have plastics in ther bodys.</p>
